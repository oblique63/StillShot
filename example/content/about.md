# Anything above the '~~~' line is interpreted as YAML,
# and is used to set variables you can access from your template tags.
# This is an example of a YAML comment which will be completely ignored.

# A basic variable definition
title: About StillShot

# A list of strings. Surrounding your strings in quotes is optional,
# but some may require it so they  don't interfere with YAML syntax.
default_vars:
  - "`title`: post title, automatically set to name of markdown file if left blank"
  - "`_site`: site.yaml values"
  - "`_date`: post 'last modified' date"
  - "`_content`: post content (only accessible from templates, not markdown)"

# Alternate List Syntax
authors: [foo, bar, baz]

# A list of Dictionaries
links:
  - name: Dart
    url: https://dartlang.org
  - name: Pub

  # alternate inline-dict style:
  - {name: Google, url: http://google.com}
  - {name: Github, url: http://github.com}

# You can even embed markdown in your YAML strings if you want (as long as you use the values
# in the markdown file itself -- markdown injected into html templates will not get evaluated).
tags:
  - "[StillShot][stillshot]"
  - "[Markdown][markdown]"
  - "[Mustache][mustache]"
  - "[YAML][yaml]"

# You can also override your 'date_format' setting from your site.yaml
# for each individual post
date_format: yMd

# And here we manually define the template we want to use.
# Note the lack of a file extension. This is to have compatibility
# with any template file-type, though mustache embedded in plain
# old HTML is the default. If no template is defined here, StillShot
# will use the one listed for 'default_template' in your site.yaml
template: info_page
~~~
3 `~`'s is the minimum for designating and separating a [YAML][yaml] block, but they can be extended longer -- all that matters
is that the tildes (`~`) are on their own line.

And anything beyond that gets interpreted as [Markdown][markdown]!

You can even use template tags in here, for any variables you set in in the top YAML block, or in your `site.yaml` file:

This post's title is: "{{ title }}"

This file was last modified on {{ _date }}

`site.yaml` greeting: {{ _site.greeting }}

Note that variables beginning with an underscore designate *implicit* metadata added by __StillShot__.

Some vars that are always available by default:

{{#default_vars}}
- {{.}}
{{/default_vars}}

And as you can see, you can also use mustache logic to iterate through yaml maps and lists:

{{#links}}
- [{{name}}]({{url}})
{{/links}}
{{#tags}}
* {{.}}
{{/tags}}
{{#authors}}
- {{.}}
{{/authors}}

Note how you need to use a `.` to access a list item, but can access map/dict keys directly.

You can of course disable these markdown templating features by setting `markdown_templating: true` in your [site.yaml](../site.yaml) file.
Same ideas apply when writing your actual HTML templates. See [mustache's docs][mustache] for more templating info.
